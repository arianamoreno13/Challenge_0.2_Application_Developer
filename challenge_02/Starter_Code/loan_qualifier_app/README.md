# Project Title


--- This is a python loan qualifier app. This app allows us to ask our users a list of loan application questions. Once we have all of their imputted data we can determine thier eligibility. Using our 'daily_rate_sheet' we can output good loan fits for the client.

* [fire](https://github.com/google/python-fire) - For the command line interface (CLI), Helps debug, and welcome page.
